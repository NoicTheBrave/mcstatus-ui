# mcstatus-ui
Originally based on https://github.com/Dinnerbone/mcstatus, this adds a more refined finish to the use of the program. @ present, it just saves a log of IP addresses you yourself enter in (no features added as of yet to remove them directly in "app") , and pings them. You can do this once, or repeatedly. The choice is yours!

This version is aimed at constantly pinging the server while the app is running, and if players are online, to report that information to you!

# Background
This was originally a replit project from a few years ago, and I have since then made a UI for this app several times. Finally decided that enough was enough and that I needed to just make a github for it, so I don't have to keep reinventing the wheel every time I want to use this thing. 

# Planned Features
* Menu to select which server to start pinging
* Change the color of the background based on the number of people online (a feature of a previous version long lost to time, helps if window is on another monitor or separate monitoring device (phone, tablet, etc), and you just want a quick glance to see if anything changed w/o having to look at text!) [was designed for up to, I believe 9 ppl before it just capped out beyond that]

# "Sources" 
* https://replit.com/@NicholasChorett/mcstatusTest#constantPing_Slowed.py
* * Also known as the "web version" of the application, this is where I first made this application. Unfortunately, I cannot develop UI on this (fair enough), and thus this project was born
* https://github.com/Dinnerbone/mcstatus
* * This was the original source
