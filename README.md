# mcstatus-ui
Originally based on https://github.com/Dinnerbone/mcstatus, this adds a more refined finish to the use of the program. @ present, it just saves a log of IP addreses you yourself enter in (no features added as of yet to remove them directly in "app") , and pings them. You can do this once, or repeatedly. Choice is yours!
